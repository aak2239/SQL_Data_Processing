Cost Estimation Project

Introduction

This repository contains SQL scripts and datasets for a cost estimation project. The project aims to analyze, aggregate, and visualize cost-related data for various projects, managed by different project managers. The data includes estimated costs, actual costs, variances, and other related metrics.

Files in the Repository

cost_estimation.sql: Contains the SQL scripts for aggregating, filtering, transforming, and analyzing the data.
cost_estimation.csv: The main dataset with details about each project, including estimated costs, actual costs, start and end dates, project managers, and more.
Other related data files and scripts.
Key Features

Aggregation: The SQL scripts provide aggregated data, such as total estimated and actual costs by project or by project manager.
Sorting and Ranking: Projects can be ranked based on their total estimated costs.
Filtering: Scripts to filter out projects based on certain criteria, such as a variance threshold or specific start date range.
Joining: Example joins with other datasets to enrich the data (e.g., joining with a project_details table).
Transformations: Includes calculations such as the percentage of the estimated cost to the actual cost.
Date Operations: Scripts to work with date data, such as calculating the duration of each project.
Usage

Setup Database: Ensure that your database system is set up and running. Import the cost_estimation.csv dataset into your database.
Run SQL Scripts: Use your database management system to run the SQL scripts in cost_estimation.sql.
Visualizations: The processed data can be used with visualization tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or Google Data Studio to derive insights.
Precautions

Ensure that any sensitive data or credentials are not pushed to the repository, especially if it's public.
Always back up your data before running any scripts, especially those that modify the data.
